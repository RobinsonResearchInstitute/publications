	journal = {Superconductor Science and Technology},
	abstract = {High current operation of HTS magnets is desirable for many applications, but operating currents are typically limited by resistive heating of the normal-conducting current leads, which connect the cryogenic magnet coil to a room-temperature electronic power supply. Rectifying flux pumps are a feasible alternative solution as they enable current to be directly injected into the HTS magnet coil via a closed superconducting circuit. In this work, we have developed and demonstrated two prototype HTS self-rectifying flux pump devices capable of delivering very high output currents. One of these devices can deliver a maximum direct current of >2 kA. This is a new record for the flux pump excitation of an HTS coil. Unlike other rectifying flux pumps, the self-rectifying flux pumps reported here do not employ an active switching component. Instead passive ‘self-switching’ rectification is achieved by applying an assymmetric current waveform to the primary winding. This significantly reduces the complexity of the system compared to other flux pump architectures, and removes the need for dissipative electronic components within the cryogenic environment. We demonstrate that these devices also function when the iron core linking the superconducting secondary and the normal conducting primary is broken by a pair of air gaps. In these conditions DC currents of >600 A can be maintained with a total air gap length of 10 mm. This indicates that this approach represents a feasible practical solution for through-wall excitation of high current HTS magnets.}

abstract={Dynamic resistance is observed in type-II superconductors carrying a DC transport current while simultaneously exposed to an alternating magnetic field. The appearance of a nonzero resistance is attributed to the interaction between the transport current and moving fluxons. This effect is relevant to many superconductor applications such as high-temperature-superconductor (HTS) flux pumps, DC/AC magnets, synchronous machines, and persistent current switches. Here, we present a finite element method (FEM) analysis of both the time averaged dynamic resistance and the instantaneous current sharing behaviour in a cable comprised of a stack of four YBCO thin films connected in parallel. Numerical modelling was performed using the H-formulation method implemented in the commercial software COMSOL. The model employs experimentally measured values of the angular dependence of the critical current I.(B, 8) and the flux creep exponent n(B, 8). A single threshold field is observed, above which a finite dynamic resistance is observed in all tapes simultaneously. The time-averaged dynamic resistance of individual tapes tends to be larger for the exterior tapes than the interior tapes, but this difference decreases as the total transport current in the cable increases. We attribute this to shielding currents flowing in the exterior tapes during the majority of the cycle, which displace net DC current into the interior tapes. However, the relative proportion of DC transport current flowing in the exterior and interior tapes is also observed to vary periodically once per half cycle of the applied field. This is due to the periodic trapping of return screening currents in the interior tapes.},  keywords={barium compounds;critical current density (superconductivity);finite element analysis;flux creep;flux flow;high-temperature superconductors;superconducting tapes;superconducting thin films;yttrium compounds;numerical modelling;parallel-connected stack;HTS coated-conductor tapes;type-II superconductors;DC transport current;alternating magnetic field;nonzero resistance;superconductor applications;persistent current switches;instantaneous current sharing behaviour;finite dynamic resistance;time-averaged dynamic resistance;exterior tapes;interior tapes;shielding currents;net DC current;return screening currents;YBCO thin films;commercial software COMSOL;H-formulation method;YBCO;Resistance;High-temperature superconductors;Magnetic fields;Finite element analysis;Numerical models;Current measurement;Conductors;Dynamic resistance;  $H$  -formulation;HTS modelling;HTS cable;parallel stack},  doi={10.1109/TASC.2020.2974860},  ISSN={1558-2515},  month={June},}

abstract={High-speed superconducting motors and generators stand to benefit from superconductor magnetic levitation bearings if their stiffness characteristics can be improved. Here we investigate a novel thrust bearing geometry, comprising a conical frustum shaped permanent magnet and matching superconducting toroid and puck assembly, aimed at producing high stiffness coupled with high levitation force. To this end, we have constructed a bearing test rig enabling measurements of the levitation force and stiffness of the assembly of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta }$ melt-textured bulks and Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B permanent magnet at temperatures down to 47 K. The experimental results are supported by finite element modeling that is validated against the experiment, and used to quantify the advantages of this configuration over a conventional cylindrical magnet and HTS puck arrangement. For axial displacements, the assembly produces higher and more consistent stiffness together with stronger restoring forces. For lateral displacements, the assembly produces up to double the lateral force and up to four times the stiffness. Our study also shows that the force contribution to the assembly from the small inner puck is negligible and it can therefore be eliminated from the bearing design.},  keywords={Conical frustum;HTS bulks;levitation force;superconducting magnetic bearing;toroid},  doi={10.1109/TASC.2020.2982884},  ISSN={1558-2515},  month={June},}

abstract={In High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) DC magnet applications, the current leads contribute a significant fraction of the cooling load. Higher current operation requires larger current leads and a larger thermal bridge into the cryogenic superconducting components. Removal of current leads into the cryogenic environment would lead to a significant reduction in cooling load and hence reduce ongoing operation costs. Superconducting dynamos are a non-contact method of energising HTS coils, capable of producing significant currents in the connected superconducting circuits that exceed usual current lead arrangements. The use of superconducting dynamos has the potential to reduce the size and mass of a complete magnet system by replacing the power source, current leads, and cryocooler. Previous work on superconducting dynamos has focused on driving larger currents, and understanding the underlying physical principles of operation, but has not investigated the AC losses associated with operation. In this work the losses of a kA class multi-stator squirrel-cage superconducting dynamo are investigated experimentally, and compared to the losses expected in the conventional copper current lead based energisation method. The thermal load associated with conduction cooled copper leads prevents practical application of kilo-amp class dc HTS magnets, however we demonstrated the feasibility of using this superconducting dynamo as an energisation method to enable feasible portable high current HTS magnet systems.},  keywords={cooling;cryogenics;DC generators;high-temperature superconductors;squirrel cage motors;superconducting coils;superconducting magnets;HTS dynamo losses;High Temperature Superconducting DC magnet applications;multistator squirrel-cage superconducting dynamo;copper current lead based energisation method;portable high current HTS magnet systems;kilo-amp class dc HTS magnets;superconducting circuits;HTS coils;Superconducting dynamos;cryogenic superconducting components;thermal bridge;DC power supply;HTS dynamo;Superconducting flux pump},  doi={10.1109/TASC.2020.2980830},  ISSN={1558-2515},  month={June},}

These materials have attracted a lot of attention due to their useful magnetotransport properties and the possibility of tailoring these properties by modifying their composition or producing heterostructures. With the diverse range of interesting phenomena in the Heusler alloys, ferromagnetic Heusler alloys are also ideal candidates for engineering spin caloritronic devices that can take advantage of the interplay of the physics of heat flow, magnetism, and electric potential. The fundamental physical concepts important to spin-dependent thermoelectrics research are introduced and recent studies of several ferromagnetic Heusler compounds are reviewed, highlighting some exceptional latest experiments on half-metallic Co2TiSn and the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa. Furthermore, the potential to generate useful magnetothermoelectric voltages in electronic devices based on the anomalous Nernst effect is discussed.}

The key steps were processing a polyvinylpyrrolidone nanofiber template containing ferric nitrate and nickel acetate metal precursors in Ar at 300°C and then 95% Ar: 5% H<sub>2</sub> at 600°C. The Ni<sub>0.47</sub>Fe<sub>0.53</sub> fibers were nanostructured and contained Ni<sub>0.47</sub>Fe<sub>0.53</sub> nanocrystals with average diameters of ~14 nm. The Ni<sub>0.47</sub>Fe<sub>0.53</sub> ferromagnetic mats had a high saturation magnetic moment per formula unit that was comparable to those reported in other studies of nanostructured Ni<sub>1-x</sub>Fe<sub>x</sub>. There is a small spin-disordered fraction that is typically seen in nanoscale ferromagnets and is likely to be caused by the surface of the nanofibers. There was an additional magnetic contribution that could possibly stem from a small Fe<sub>1-z</sub>Ni<sub>z</sub>O phase fraction surrounding the fibers. The coercivity was found to be enhanced when compared with the bulk material.}

Although analytical expressions of dynamic loss have been proposed and verified for HTS CCs exposed to low external magnetic fields with a low current load rate, the non-linearity of dynamic loss at high current load ratios and simultaneous high magnetic fields is still unclear and cannot be predicted by the existing analytical equations. This paper proposes a completely new formulation to characterize the non-linearity of dynamic loss taking into account the J

The proposed transformer consists of four single-phase 25 kV/1.9 kV HTS windings, operating at 65 K, each of which drives a motor. The design incorporates Roebel cable in the LV windings to cope with large current and minimize AC loss. We present 2D FEM AC loss modelling results that identify the critical parameters that contribute to AC loss. We show that the combination of winding length ≥1 m, high performance Fujikura wires, and flux diverters arranged at the end of HV and LV windings, can restrain AC loss in the HTS windings to under 2 kW. We introduce an open-loop cooling system concept with sub-cooler integrated inside the transformer cryostat that can achieve total system weight under 3 tons assuming 2.5 kW total heat load and 8 h of continuous running time. A nominal efficiency of 99.5% can be achieved for this total heat load.

	abstract = {Dynamic resistance can be observed in a superconducting tape carrying a DC current which is exposed to an oscillating magnetic field. This effect is attributed to the interaction between the transport current and moving fluxons, and can occur in various superconducting components including high temperature superconducting (HTS) flux pumps, fast-ramping magnets and HTS rotating machines. Although conventionally expressed in terms of a DC ‘resistance,’ the phenomenon is inherently transient in nature, and the voltage drop across the superconductor follows a time-dependent periodic waveform. Here we present experimental measurements of the dynamic resistance of different REBCO tapes carrying a DC current and exposed to an oscillating perpendicular field. Measurements of both the transient voltage waveforms and the time-averaged DC resistances are compared with numerical finite element simulations obtained using the H-formulation. We observe clear variations between the voltage response from different tapes, which can be understood in terms of their differing J
c(B, θ) dependence. In particular, a key feature of the experimentally measured waveforms is the emergence of a split ‘double peak’ at higher applied fields. Graphical visualisations of the finite element data show that this coincides with a periodic increase in J
c(B, θ) throughout the tape. This occurs during each cycle at those times when the applied field falls below the shielding threshold of the tape (as the penetrating field within the tape then approaches zero). Our findings show that models which assume a constant J
c irrespective of local field strength cannot capture the full range of behaviour observed by experiment. This emphasises the importance of employing experimentally measured J
c(B, θ) data when simulating transient effects in HTS materials.}

Although the loss characteristics around power frequency have been well studied, it is still unclear how loss varies towards high frequencies above kHz level, which is important to a wide range of applications, such as wireless power transfer. This paper is to investigate the frequency dependence of both magnetization and transport current loss in HTS CCs and therefore, to provide comprehensive analyses through a detailed multilayer model reflecting their actual structures. In this paper, a 
T
-formulation based multilayer numerical model for HTS CCs, consisting of HTS layer, substrate, silver overlayer, and copper stabilizers, has been developed. Both magnetization loss and transport current loss over a wide frequency range, from 50 Hz to 1 MHz, have been simulated and discussed. The results obtained by the existing thin film model based on 
T
-formulation, multilayer model and homogenization model by 
H
-formulation are also presented and compared. The proposed multilayer model has been validated by experimental measurements, which has proven the widely adopted HTS thin film model to be inapplicable for frequencies above 100 Hz. In addition, most magnetization losses occur in the copper stabilizers above 1.2 kHz due to skin effect. Results can be used to study the performance of HTS devices towards high frequencies at kHz or even MHz level.}
